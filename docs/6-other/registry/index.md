### Image Registry

Tenzar DX acts as a private Image Registry. Image registries are offered by many online cloud providers such as Docker Cloud and Google Cloud - they allow you to push and pull docker images to the cloud. 

Images on DX are tightly integrated with the platform and, like volumes, can be shared with others on DX. Our import functionality allows you to pull images from other registries (such as Docker Hub) and the web directly into DX. You can also upload private images directly from the terminal.

Image uploads on Tenzar DX are accelerated with the same technology we use for Volumes, allowing fast, robust, and secure transfers that account for changes in data.
